# Overview

This project involves the manual testing of two related platforms: EasyPay, a mobile financial service (MFS) app, and the dmoney website. 
The acceptance criteria and test cases were designed and executed for features available in the EasyPay app. The project focuses on validating few primary features: merchant payments, customer payments, service charges, cashback, and the loan facility.  
However, the bug report was generated based on issues encountered during testing on the dmoney website, which handles money transactions (e.g., deposit, withdraw, transfer, payment) and user management for customers, admins, agents, and merchant.
